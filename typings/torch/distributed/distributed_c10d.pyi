    """
    Initializes the default distributed process group, and this will also
    initialize the distributed package.

    There are 2 main ways to initialize a process group:
        1. Specify ``store``, ``rank``, and ``world_size`` explicitly.
        2. Specify ``init_method`` (a URL string) which indicates where/how
           to discover peers. Optionally specify ``rank`` and ``world_size``,
           or encode all required parameters in the URL and omit them.

    If neither is specified, ``init_method`` is assumed to be "env://".


    Arguments:
        backend (str or Backend): The backend to use. Depending on
            build-time configurations, valid values include ``mpi``, ``gloo``,
            and ``nccl``. This field should be given as a lowercase string
            (e.g., ``"gloo"``), which can also be accessed via
            :class:`Backend` attributes (e.g., ``Backend.GLOO``). If using
            multiple processes per machine with ``nccl`` backend, each process
            must have exclusive access to every GPU it uses, as sharing GPUs
            between processes can result in deadlocks.
        init_method (str, optional): URL specifying how to initialize the
                                     process group. Default is "env://" if no
                                     ``init_method`` or ``store`` is specified.
                                     Mutually exclusive with ``store``.
        world_size (int, optional): Number of processes participating in
                                    the job. Required if ``store`` is specified.
        rank (int, optional): Rank of the current process.
                              Required if ``store`` is specified.
        store(Store, optional): Key/value store accessible to all workers, used
                                to exchange connection/address information.
                                Mutually exclusive with ``init_method``.
        timeout (timedelta, optional): Timeout for operations executed against
            the process group. Default value equals 30 minutes.
            This is applicable for the ``gloo`` backend. For ``nccl``, this is
            applicable only if the environment variable ``NCCL_BLOCKING_WAIT``
            or ``NCCL_ASYNC_ERROR_HANDLING`` is set to 1. When
            ``NCCL_BLOCKING_WAIT`` is set, this is the duration for which the
            process will block and wait for collectives to complete before
            throwing an exception. When ``NCCL_ASYNC_ERROR_HANDLING`` is set,
            this is the duration after which collectives will be aborted
            asynchronously and the process will crash. ``NCCL_BLOCKING_WAIT``
            will provide errors to the user which can be caught and handled,
            but due to its blocking nature, it has a performance overhead. On
            the other hand, ``NCCL_ASYNC_ERROR_HANDLING`` has little
            performance overhead, but crashes the process on errors. This is
            done since CUDA execution is async and it is no longer safe to
            continue executing user code since failed async NCCL operations
            might result in subsequent CUDA operations to run on corrupted
            data. Only one of these two environment variables should be set.
        group_name (str, optional, deprecated): Group name.

    To enable ``backend == Backend.MPI``, PyTorch needs to be built from source
    on a system that supports MPI.

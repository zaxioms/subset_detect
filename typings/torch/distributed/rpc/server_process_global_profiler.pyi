from torch.autograd.profiler import profile

class _server_process_global_profile(profile):
    """
    It has the same API as ``torch.autograd.profiler.profile`` class,
    except that it enables profiling on all threads running RPC server request callbacks.

    Context manager that manages autograd profiler state and holds a summary of results.
    Under the hood it just records events of functions being executed in C++ and
    exposes those events to Python. You can wrap any code into it and it will
    only report runtime of PyTorch functions.
    Note: profiler is thread local and is automatically propagated into the async tasks

    Arguments:
        enabled (bool, optional): Setting this to False makes this context manager a no-op.
            Default: ``True``.

        use_cuda (bool, optional): Enables timing of CUDA events as well using the cudaEvent API.
            Adds approximately 4us of overhead to each tensor operation.
            Default: ``False``

        record_shapes (bool, optional): If shapes recording is set, information
            about input dimensions will be collected. This allows one to see which
            dimensions have been used under the hood and further group by them
            using prof.key_averages(group_by_input_shape=True). Please note that
            shape recording might skew your profiling data. It is recommended to
            use separate runs with and without shape recording to validate the timing.
            Most likely the skew will be negligible for bottom most events (in a case
            of nested function calls). But for higher level functions the total
            self cpu time might be artificially increased because of the shape
            collection.

        profile_memory (bool, optional): Whether to report memory usage, default: ``False``

    .. warning:
        Enabling memory profiling incurs additional profiler overhead

    .. warning:
        Due to some CUDA multiprocessing limitations (multiprocessing-cuda-note_),
        one cannot use the profiler with ``use_cuda = True`` to benchmark
        DataLoaders with ``num_workers > 0``. If you wish to benchmark data loading,
        please use ``use_cuda = False`` or ``num_workers = 0``.

    Example:
        >>> # On worker 0:
        >>> import torch
        >>> import torch.distributed.rpc as rpc
        >>> rpc.init_rpc("worker0", rank=0, world_size=2)
        >>> x, y = torch.tensor(1), torch.tensor(2)
        >>> outer_profile_rref = rpc.remote(dst_worker_name, rpc._server_process_global_profile)
        >>> outer_profile_rref.rpc_sync().__enter__()
        >>> rpc.rpc_sync(dst_worker_name, torch.add, (x, y))
        >>> inner_profile_rref = rpc.remote(dst_worker_name, rpc._server_process_global_profile)
        >>> inner_profile_rref.rpc_sync().__enter__()
        >>> rpc.rpc_sync(dst_worker_name, torch.sub, (x, y))
        >>> inner_profile_rref.rpc_sync().__exit__(None, None, None)
        >>> outer_profile_rref.rpc_sync().__exit__(None, None, None
        >>> print(inner_profile_rref.rpc_sync().key_averages())

class Cauchy(Distribution):
    r"""
    Samples from a Cauchy (Lorentz) distribution. The distribution of the ratio of
    independent normally distributed random variables with means `0` follows a
    Cauchy distribution.

    Example::

        >>> m = Cauchy(torch.tensor([0.0]), torch.tensor([1.0]))
        >>> m.sample()  # sample from a Cauchy distribution with loc=0 and scale=1
        tensor([ 2.3214])

    Args:
        loc (float or Tensor): mode or median of the distribution.
        scale (float or Tensor): half width at half maximum.

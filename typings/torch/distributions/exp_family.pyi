class ExponentialFamily(Distribution):
    r"""
    ExponentialFamily is the abstract base class for probability distributions belonging to an
    exponential family, whose probability mass/density function has the form is defined below

    .. math::

        p_{F}(x; \theta) = \exp(\langle t(x), \theta\rangle - F(\theta) + k(x))

    where :math:`\theta` denotes the natural parameters, :math:`t(x)` denotes the sufficient statistic,
    :math:`F(\theta)` is the log normalizer function for a given family and :math:`k(x)` is the carrier
    measure.

    Note:
        This class is an intermediary between the `Distribution` class and distributions which belong
        to an exponential family mainly to check the correctness of the `.entropy()` and analytic KL
        divergence methods. We use this class to compute the entropy and KL divergence using the AD
        framework and Bregman divergences (courtesy of: Frank Nielsen and Richard Nock, Entropies and
        Cross-entropies of Exponential Families).

class Chi2(Gamma):

    Creates a Chi2 distribution parameterized by shape parameter :attr:`df`.
    This is exactly equivalent to ``Gamma(alpha=0.5*df, beta=0.5)``

    Example::

        >>> m = Chi2(torch.tensor([1.0]))
        >>> m.sample()  # Chi2 distributed with shape df=1
        tensor([ 0.1046])

        df (float or Tensor): shape parameter of the distribution

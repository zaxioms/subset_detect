class Laplace(Distribution):

    Creates a Laplace distribution parameterized by :attr:`loc` and :attr:`scale`.

    Example::

        >>> m = Laplace(torch.tensor([0.0]), torch.tensor([1.0]))
        >>> m.sample()  # Laplace distributed with loc=0, scale=1
        tensor([ 0.1046])

    Args:
        loc (float or Tensor): mean of the distribution
        scale (float or Tensor): scale of the distribution

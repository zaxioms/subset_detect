class NegativeBinomial(Distribution):
    r"""
    Creates a Negative Binomial distribution, i.e. distribution
    of the number of successful independent and identical Bernoulli trials
    before :attr:`total_count` failures are achieved. The probability
    of success of each Bernoulli trial is :attr:`probs`.

    Args:
        total_count (float or Tensor): non-negative number of negative Bernoulli
            trials to stop, although the distribution is still valid for real
            valued count
        probs (Tensor): Event probabilities of success in the half open interval [0, 1)
        logits (Tensor): Event log-odds for probabilities of success

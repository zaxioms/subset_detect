class Beta(ExponentialFamily):

    Beta distribution parameterized by :attr:`concentration1` and :attr:`concentration0`.

    Example::

        >>> m = Beta(torch.tensor([0.5]), torch.tensor([0.5]))
        >>> m.sample()  # Beta distributed with concentration concentration1 and concentration0
        tensor([ 0.1046])

    Args:
        concentration1 (float or Tensor): 1st concentration parameter of the distribution
            (often referred to as alpha)
        concentration0 (float or Tensor): 2nd concentration parameter of the distribution
            (often referred to as beta)

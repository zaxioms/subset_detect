    Creates a Fisher-Snedecor distribution parameterized by :attr:`df1` and :attr:`df2`.

    Example::

        >>> m = FisherSnedecor(torch.tensor([1.0]), torch.tensor([2.0]))
        >>> m.sample()  # Fisher-Snedecor-distributed with df1=1 and df2=2
        tensor([ 0.2453])

    Args:
        df1 (float or Tensor): degrees of freedom parameter 1
        df2 (float or Tensor): degrees of freedom parameter 2

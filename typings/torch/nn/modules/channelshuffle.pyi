class ChannelShuffle(Module):
    r"""Divide the channels in a tensor of shape :math:`(*, C , H, W)`
    into g groups and rearrange them as :math:`(*, C \frac g, g, H, W)`,
    while keeping the original tensor shape.

    Args:
        groups (int): number of groups to divide channels in.

    Examples::

        >>> channel_shuffle = nn.ChannelShuffle(2)
        >>> input = torch.randn(1, 4, 2, 2)

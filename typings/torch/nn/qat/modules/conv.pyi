    A Conv2d module attached with FakeQuantize modules for weight,
    used for quantization aware training.

    We adopt the same interface as `torch.nn.Conv2d`, please see
    https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html?highlight=conv2d#torch.nn.Conv2d
    for documentation.

    Similar to `torch.nn.Conv2d`, with FakeQuantize modules initialized to
    default.

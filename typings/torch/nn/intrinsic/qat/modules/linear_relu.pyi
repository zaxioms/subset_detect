class LinearReLU(nnqat.Linear):
    r"""
    A LinearReLU module fused from Linear and ReLU modules, attached with
    FakeQuantize modules for weight, used in
    quantization aware training.

    We adopt the same interface as :class:`torch.nn.Linear`.

    Similar to `torch.nn.intrinsic.LinearReLU`, with FakeQuantize modules initialized to
    default.

    Attributes:
        weight: fake quant module for weight

    Examples::

        >>> m = nn.qat.LinearReLU(20, 30)
        >>> input = torch.randn(128, 20)
        >>> output = m(input)
        >>> print(output.size())
        torch.Size([128, 30])

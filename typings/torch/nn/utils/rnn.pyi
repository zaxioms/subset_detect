class PackedSequence(PackedSequence_):
    r"""Holds the data and list of :attr:`batch_sizes` of a packed sequence.

    All RNN modules accept packed sequences as inputs.

    Note:
        Instances of this class should never be created manually. They are meant
        to be instantiated by functions like :func:`pack_padded_sequence`.

        Batch sizes represent the number elements at each sequence step in
        the batch, not the varying sequence lengths passed to
        :func:`pack_padded_sequence`.  For instance, given data ``abc`` and ``x``
        the :class:`PackedSequence` would contain data ``axbc`` with
        ``batch_sizes=[2,1,1]``.

    Attributes:
        data (Tensor): Tensor containing packed sequence
        batch_sizes (Tensor): Tensor of integers holding
            information about the batch size at each sequence step
        sorted_indices (Tensor, optional): Tensor of integers holding how this
            :class:`PackedSequence` is constructed from sequences.
        unsorted_indices (Tensor, optional): Tensor of integers holding how this
            to recover the original sequences with correct order.

    .. note::
        :attr:`data` can be on arbitrary device and of arbitrary dtype.
        :attr:`sorted_indices` and :attr:`unsorted_indices` must be ``torch.int64``
        tensors on the same device as :attr:`data`.

        However, :attr:`batch_sizes` should always be a CPU ``torch.int64`` tensor.

        This invariant is maintained throughout :class:`PackedSequence` class,
        and all functions that construct a `:class:PackedSequence` in PyTorch
        (i.e., they only pass in tensors conforming to this constraint).

    :attr:`input` can be of size ``T x B x *`` where `T` is the length of the
    longest sequence (equal to ``lengths[0]``), ``B`` is the batch size, and
    ``*`` is any number of dimensions (including 0). If ``batch_first`` is
    ``True``, ``B x T x *`` :attr:`input` is expected.

    For unsorted sequences, use `enforce_sorted = False`. If :attr:`enforce_sorted` is
    ``True``, the sequences should be sorted by length in a decreasing order, i.e.
    ``input[:,0]`` should be the longest sequence, and ``input[:,B-1]`` the shortest
    one. `enforce_sorted = True` is only necessary for ONNX export.

    Note:
        This function accepts any input that has at least two dimensions. You
        can apply it to pack the labels, and use the output of the RNN with
        them to compute the loss directly. A Tensor can be retrieved from
        a :class:`PackedSequence` object by accessing its ``.data`` attribute.

    Arguments:
        input (Tensor): padded batch of variable length sequences.
        lengths (Tensor): list of sequences lengths of each batch element.
        batch_first (bool, optional): if ``True``, the input is expected in ``B x T x *``

        enforce_sorted (bool, optional): if ``True``, the input is expected to
            contain sequences sorted by length in a decreasing order. If

    of the longest sequence and `B` is the batch size. If ``batch_first`` is True,

        See :ref:`this FAQ section <pack-rnn-unpack-with-data-parallelism>` for
        details.

    Arguments:
        sequence (PackedSequence): batch to pad

            format.
        padding_value (float, optional): values for padded elements.
        total_length (int, optional): if not ``None``, the output will be padded to
